# @atomic-ehr/ucum-playground

Interactive Next.js playground demonstrating real UCUM (Unified Code for Units of Measure) functionality. 
This application showcases the capabilities of the [@atomic-ehr/ucum](https://github.com/atomic-ehr/ucum) library through an intuitive web interface.

Demo: [https://atomic-ehr-ucum.vercel.app/](https://atomic-ehr-ucum.vercel.app/)

## Features

- ðŸŽ® **Live UCUM Parsing** - Real-time expression parsing with dimensional analysis
- ðŸ”„ **Unit Conversion** - Interactive conversion between compatible UCUM units  
- ðŸ“‹ **FHIR Quantity Builder** - Create and validate FHIR-compliant quantity objects
- âž• **Quantity Operations** - Visual arithmetic operations (add, subtract, compare)
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first interface with Tailwind CSS
- âš¡ **Real UCUM Integration** - Uses actual core library, no mock implementations

## Quick Start
